# BC Conservation Prioritization Tool

The **BC Conservation Prioritization Tool** is a decision-support system for identifying high-priority conservation areas. Users choose the **landscape characteristics** they want to conserve, define an **area of interest**, and optionally set a **budget**. Each characteristic can be given a **relative importance value**, and the tool then highlights the areas that best satisfy the selected criteria.
